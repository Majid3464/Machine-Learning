### 1. Dimensionality reduction
• A comprehensive guide to dimensionality reduction

### 2. Linear Regression
• Feature engineering for a house price dataset with 2919 entries and 80 features. 

• Applied the models: Linear regression, Elastic-net, Lasso, Ridge, Lassolars, Bayesian ridge, Kernel ridge, Kneighbors regressor,cross validated the models and found ideal hyper-parameters to minimize cost functions. 

• Predicted sales prices using RFs and Gradient boosting with more than 90% accuracy.

### 3. Nueral-Networks
• Data analysis(transformation,visualization and wrangling)for classiﬁcation problems using adiabetes dataset. 

• Applied both parametric and non-parametric classiﬁers such as Bagging classiﬁer, K-neighbors classiﬁer, Decision tree classiﬁer and Neural networks to predict diabetes.

• Optimized the models and predicted diabetes to 90 percent accuracy.

### 4. Regularization
